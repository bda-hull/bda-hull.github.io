<i style="font-size:25pt; align:center;">Welcome! </i><p></br> We are the Big Data Analytics research group (BDA) in the <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/faculties/departments/research/department-of-computer-science-and-technology#content">Department of Computer Science and Technology (CST)</a> at the University of Hull.
		 
We collaborate with the <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/research/groups/dependable-intelligent-systems">Dependable Intelligent Systems (DEIS) research group</a> in CST, 
and also work closely with other parts of the university, including the

<a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/research/institutes/energy-and-environment-institute">Energy and Environment Institute</a>, and the 
<a href="https://auracdt.hull.ac.uk/">Aura Centre for Doctoral Training Centre in Oﬀshore Wind Energy and the Environment</a>. </br></br>

We first came together as a group in 2017 and have since been growing an interdisciplinary research portfolio in artificial intelligence and 
data analytics, particularly focusing on research in (deep) machine learning, interactive systems and natural language processing, and increasingly 
AI for sustainability and environmental modelling. We have an increasing number of collaborations with partners in academia, industry and the
public sector, generating novel fundamental research,  knowledge transfer and impact acceleration projects. <br><br>

						<h3 align="left">Deep Learning and Data Analytics</h3>
						<p align="left">We apply machine learning, mostly deep learning, in all our research projects, 
						 due to its ability to learn features from large datasets and identify 
						 patterns in disparate, large and noisy datasets. Most of our work on natural language processing and 
						 other time-series applications uses LSTM/GRU or transformer models (e.g. for sentiment analysis, natural language generation) 
						 while other projects in image analysis and sensory output analysis have used CNNs or autoencoders.</p>
						<p align="left">Our research in this area focuses on deep learning models that are transparent and
						interpretable and can explain the rationales behind their actions - this is important in many commercial
						and real-life applications to increase trust, helps to avoid bias and discrimination in AI models, 
						and makes them generally more accountable. </p>						 
					<p align="left">We are also interested in fast learning systems and investigate topics in transfer learning, 
					divide-and-conquer approaches to learning and efficiency. See our <a href="deep_learning.html#publications">deep learning publications</a> for details.</p>

						<h3 align="right">Natural Language and Social Media</h3>
						<p align="right">Natural language processing (NLP) refers to approaches that analyse, generate and 
						process natural language automatically using computational techniques and algorithms, mostly based on 
						machine learning. Our strengths lie in natural language generation, that is the automatic generation of 
						language from non-linguistic data sources, such as data-to-text generation, (spoken) dialogue systems, i.e. systems
						that engage in conversations with users to solve problems or provide information, sentiment 
						analysis in text and social media and text classification and analysis. </p>
						<p align="right">We are also interested in social media analysis, including projects on sentiment analysis
						and mental health based on linguistic profiling, flood forecasting and emergency situation assessment from social media and topics in digital
						conservation, such as public opinion mining and the monitoring of species. 
						See our <a href="nlp.html#publications">natural language processing publications</a> for details.</p>

						<h3 align="left">Interactive Systems and Decision Support </h3>
						<p align="left">Interactive systems can interact with their users in different ways, including text, 
						speech, haptic or other multimodal input. A common distinction is between task-oriented interactive 
						systems that target a particular domain, e.g. answering user queries on restaurant or tourist attractions 
						in the local area, and open-domain systems who attempt to answer any question, e.g. using information 
						retrieval methods from the web. Most personal assistant fall into the latter category. Finally, 
						chatbots have no purpose of informing but rather aim to entertain users by engaging in casual chat.</p>
						<p align="left">Our group is interested in human-like behaviour of interactive systems, e.g. the incremental
						planning of utterances and the analysis of linguistic features in different conversational contexts.
						Most recently we have worked on interactive decision support systems for various
						real-life applications, most notably in the wind domain, where we use interaction as a way to provide
						easy and intuitive access to the inner workings of wind turbines to support operations and maintenance.
						See our <a href="interactive_systems.html#publications">interactive systems publications</a> for details.</p>

						<h3 align="right">Sustainability and the Environment</h3>
						<p align="right">We are applying AI and machine learning techniques to help solve problems in 
						sustainability and environmental research. We are part of the EPSRC Aura CDT on Offshore Wind and 
						the Environment, and we have a strong interest in the digitalisation of offshore wind. As part of this, 
						we use AI to improve operations and maintenance
						of wind turbines to improve their reliability and usability as an alternative to fossil fuel-based 
						energy sources. We achieve this through detailed and explainable fault forecasting
						and the automatic generation of maintenance strategies from expert knowledge sources. </p></br>
						<p align="right">Other research includes the forecasting of floods from
						high-frequency and social media data sources and the monitoring of water 
						quality in the North Sea from sensory data and satellite images to achieve longer-term forecasting
						of the effects of human activity or environmental factors on water quality. We are currently growing
						our research on using AI towards the conservation of species.

I am also currently Director of Research for Computer Science and Technology and Aura CDT Theme lead for "Big data, sensors and digitalisation for the offshore environment".							
Before coming to Hull, I was a Research Fellow in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hwinteractionlab/">The Interaction Lab</a> at <a href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/">Heriot-Watt University</a>, Edinburgh. I have a PhD in Computational Linguistics from the <a href="https://www.uni-bremen.de/">University of Bremen</a>, Germany.</p>
<p>My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), particularly in the areas of data-to-text and natural language generation (NLG), interactive systems, assistive technologies, 
 domain transfer and adaptability for data analytics in a wider AI context. I have spent the last few years working with neural networks as a primary algorithm family but have previously worked with graphical models, clustering and 
reinforcement learning. 
Most recently I have become interested in applying AI and NLP in "useful" contexts such as mental health  and
the environment, particularly towards sustainability. I am interested in the digitalisation of the offshore wind industry to 
make wind turbines more reliable. I am also interested in the effects of human activity on water quality and the forecasting of 
natural events such as floods. When I have time I do some research in digital conservation using AI and text classification.</p>

Her PhD project investigates deep learning algorithms for real-time flood prediction from multiple disparate data sources. An
underlying idea of Lydia's research is to combine traditional hydro-dynamic flood models with modern AI techniques to achieve 
a balance between high accuracy of forecasts and efficient predictions. The learning models are trained with information from 
different sources including heights maps of the geographical area, dynamic rainfall radar data, as well as social media posts.

Onatkut is currently a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Hull. He holds an MSc degree from the University
of Manchester. For his PhD project, he 
 investigates deep learning techniques to discover key predictors of water quality from 
high-frequency sensor outputs. These techniques aim to be as much as possible independent of particular geographical 
locations but rather rooted in the environmental context in which they occur. This can make them potentially transferable 
across different water bodies and regions of the world, including e.g. phenomena such as proximity of water to farmland, 
caves, industrial activity, impact of natural phenomena, such as land slides, floods, and other weather events. The
overarching goal of the project is to be able to understand and predict the impact of human activity on aquatic 
ecosystems and wildlife.

							the <a href="https://www.hull.ac.uk/work-with-us/research/institutes/energy-and-environment-institute">Energy and Environment Institute</a>. 
							We spotten hedges from the air, predicted the structural health of wind turbine monopiles, and predicted
							floods from social media.
