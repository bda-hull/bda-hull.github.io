										Parkinson‚Äôs disease is one of the most complex neurological disorders which have affected mankind since ages. Recent studies in the field of Biomedical Engineering have shown that by analyzing the Verbal Response of any human being, it is highly feasible to predict the odds of having the deadly disease. A simple analysis of an utterance of ‚Äúahh‚Äù sound by a person can help to analyze the person‚Äôs state of neurological health from a layman‚Äôs perspective. The paper initially utilizes the SVM (Support Vector Machine) Learning algorithm to predict the odds of having the Parkinson‚Äôs disease from a variety of audio samples consisting of healthy and unhealthy population. The cepstral features are used to develop a Real-Time Program for user-friendly application which asks the user to utter ‚Äúahh‚Äù for as long and as boldly as possible and finally displays whether the user has Parkinson‚Äôs Disease or not. The Real-Time Program can prove to be a helpful tool for the people as well as the medical community in general, assisting in early diagnosis of the Parkinson‚Äôs disease.

										With the advent of Electronics across the globe, the use of LEDs in electronic devices, right from the ones in a remote control to the ones used for warehouse li ghting has increased exponentially. The prime consideration while designing the LEDs remains the same, minimal power consumption and maximum emission efficiency. GaAs based Light Emitting Diodes generally operates in the near Infrared Region (IR) emitting infrared light. As infrared light cannot be detected by naked human eyes, GaAs based LEDs find use in Remote Controllers, Medical treatment applications, cameras and so on. The paper deals with modelling GaAs based LED, which has a high emission efficiency and consumes minimal power. Based on suitable p-type doping near the n-wafer, high rate of excitation is obtained in the IR region [2], thus facilitating maximum efficiency of the output light. This can pave way for an application of GaAs based LEDs in various optoelectronic applications in the coming future.

										With the rise in Air Traffic flow across the world due to advancement in technology and developments in the field of aeronautical engineering, the cases of emergency and panic situations on flights have also emerged at an exponential rate. Every single day, we hear of emergency situations in flights like fires, birdstrikes, diversions, engine failures and emergency landings etc. Across the globe, Air Traffic Controllers are constantly monitoring the in-flight situation based on inputs from the pilots and advicing them on possible diversions or measures to take so as to avoid any danger to the lifes of passengers and the cabin crew. Though, the manual monitoring of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) Conversations is efficient and reliable, but still, it may be subject to human bias and glitches. Also, post-flight monitoring is difficult because there is no such automatic measure for arriving at the conclusion, whether the flight faced an emergency or not. Audio Signal Processing finds an interesting use in this case. By extracting some crucial features from an audio conversation, one can proceed towards the classification once the features seem good and efficient. The paper mainly focusses on extracting these features critical to ATC analysis. In the future, with availability of good database, the paper can be expanded to classify the conversations using Machine Learning techniques.

										In this Globalized world, the Call Centers and BPOsare increasing at an exponential rate. There is stiff competitionamong various companies and every company wants to have itsclients happy and satisfied with the resolution of the problems. For this purpose, Agent Quality Monitoring is an importantrequirement. Since in a typical Call Centre, thousands of calls aremade by agents in a single day, it is not possible to manuallyidentify problematic calls by monitoring each and every agentclientconversation. Moreover, sometimes, individual monitoringis biased. What is non problematic for one can be problematic foranother individual. Moreover, it is almost impossible to manuallyidentify problematic calls in a language one doesn't know. Without a suitable technical approach, it is difficult to identifyproblematic calls without translating the call contents into ourlanguage, which often leads to security and privacy concerns fora private company. In this paper a sample of calls was taken anda proper technical approach is used to analyze the calls. Thedesign of the proposed system is language independent. In thisproject, we make use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier based on 4 robust audio features, namely MelFrequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Energy, Volume andZero Crossing Rate (ZCR). The support vectors are obtained bytraining the sample data set. The SVM Classifier is based on asimple algorithm which solves the two class problem andclassifies the calls as problematic or non-problematic. Duringexperiments 87.5% of the calls are identified correctly.

										This paper proposes a method to identify and assess different levels of anger from the speech utterances. Unlike the existing methods which only detect the emotion from speech, the proposed method not only detects but also labels the level of an emotion. A 75 dimensional feature vector has been extracted from each audio clip and is used for training and testing. For classification and assessment the adaptive boosting algorithm is used. Experiments were performed on a dataset of seven emotions. 231 audio clips were used for training and 100 were used for testing. The accuracy of the proposed system to detect'Angry'emotion is 78.3%. All the angry clips are classified into low, medium and high level of anger.

										In the last few decades, innovations have played a major role in economic growth and development of the
modern economies. Extensive Research and Development in the fields of Engineering and Technology have been
the catalysts, culminating the economic growth and development of the modern economies. Engineers and
Economists have been interdependent on one another for various technical know-how. The rapid advances in the
field of Economics due to formulation of various Economic Laws and theories have given the modern economies
sufficient ideas and methodologies to make well-planned decisions. Engineers have been interdependent on the
economists for the development of various technological equipment‚Äôs, machines, gadgets etc. useful for the modern
industries as they want to maximize their production efficiency, at the same time, minimizing the cost of production.
The rapid innovations in Engineering and Technology have made the world a global Market, not limited to the
boundaries of a country. Due to technological up gradation in the modern economies, there has been increase in
employment, reduction in poverty, and growth of Human Capital, which have together triggered the economic growth
of the modern economies, as concluded from my research.
